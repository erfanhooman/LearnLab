"""Docker"""

- DOCKER:
    DOCKER FILE is a file that contain instruction, docker use this file to convert instruction to the image
    IMAGE its contain anything that application need to be run (such as os, operating file, external packages)
    then we can use the image to create an isolated environment know as CONTAINER

- To start the docker first we create a 'DockerFile'
    ""NOTE:you can see the commands in DockerFile""
    
    then use the command 
        "docker build -t my-python-app ." 
            to build an image
    
    And finally, you can run your Docker container:
        "docker run my-python-app"
        
    you can see the image in your system with this command:
        "docker image ls"


- You can push your image on dockerhub with this instruction:
    first tag you image :
        "docker tag my-python-app <yourusername>/my-python-app:<tag>"
        
    login to dockerhub:
        "docker login"
    Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted
    
    push your image:
        "docker push yourusername/my-python-app:<tag>"
    
    
- After pushing that you can test your image on the play with docker
    after opening the "https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker/" pull your image with command   
        "docker pull "yourusername/my-python-app"
    
    then you can see your image and run the docker container
